# **Sklair 0.1.0 🎉**

*HTML deserved better.*

This is the **first official release** of Sklair - a compiler that brings structure, composability, and performance back to plain HTML without turning the web into a JavaScript framework.

---

## What's included in v0.1.0 🥹

This release is a bit more than just a prototype, its a complete pipeline that works. But as always, improvements can be made.

### Component system

- HTML files act as components
- Components can define both `<head>` and `<body>` content
- Head nodes are automatically deduplicated across components
- Components are cached lazily for performance

### Heuristic head ordering pass

Sklair doesn’t just concatenate `<head>` tags, it **understands** them.

- Nodes are classified (charset, viewport, styles, scripts, analytics, SEO, etc.)
- They are sorted into an optimal order
- Duplicates are removed using structural hashing
- Social meta (OpenGraph + Twitter) and others which have no effect on what a user sees at all is grouped and placed at the end

### Ordering barriers

During the head ordering pass, some things might break if they are moved around in the wrong order.

The best example I can think of is importing `cdn.tailwindcss.com` and needing `tailwind.config` to come *after* the TailwindCSS script is imported, not before.

Some things must stay together. Sklair lets you enforce that.

```html
<!-- sklair:ordering-barrier treat-as=dont-care -->
<meta property="og:title" …>
<meta name="twitter:title" …>
<!-- sklair:ordering-barrier-end -->
```

Sklair will keep those nodes together while still optimising everything else.

### `sklair:remove`

You can include tags for editor previews that will **never ship**:

```html
<!-- sklair:remove -->
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
<!-- sklair:remove-end -->
```

This is perfect for things like component previews in VSCode without polluting production builds.

### gitignore-style excludes

No more ugly `**/**/**`, Sklair now accepts gitignore-style excludes which are automatically normalised to doublestar globs.

```json
"exclude": [
  ".git",
  "node_modules",
  ".env*",
  "*.psd",
  "!important.psd"
]
```

### `sklair serve`

A real development server with file watching via [fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify), automatic rebuilds, websocket-based live reload, and support for custom user-created 404 pages.

### ⚙️ Proper CLI

- `sklair build`
- `sklair config`
- `sklair docs`
- `sklair init`
- `sklair serve`
- `sklair version`
- Global `--debug`, `--verbose`, `--silent` verbosity flags

Note that the verbosity flags must come before any command. E.g. `sklair --debug build`.

## Whats next

0.1.0 is the foundation, for now. Coming next will be component nesting, circular dependency detection, dynamic resource hints, full Lua block support, a stable pre/post-build hook system, and finally distribution of sklair via package managers like brew, winget and maybe apt.

**HTML deserved better.
Now it has Sklair.**
